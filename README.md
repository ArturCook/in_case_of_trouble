<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This was a decision-making tool I built for a friend back in 2022. It was originally an HTML file I sent via Telegram. Later I updated it and put it on Github, only so I can host it online and to send people the link. I added support for English just because. Other people suggested I add other languages. I said *"lol, sure"*.

The [image in here](https://www.instagram.com/p/C2YgjPgBgo2/) was commissioned by me, for me to use in this project, made using an iPad, by none other than myself. More context of how it came to be can be found [in here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Al7hrkhiELTRLPRLHGMo1rjseLiTEp-_K51fdxT3oI4/edit#heading=h.v8ped9sw6luu), under the **PowerUser** section. The link will take you directly there.

It then became a [full text](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nhoM91mAQjcdlVoDwfj2UoEHs_M3Dp_ldV_9QW5PEtY/edit) on principles of software development. Same idea. Meant to be funny, but has some truth to it. Written also by me. It's also distributed under MIT License.

Don't forget to give the project a star! I'm not too sure what that means. I don't use Github that much. But I'm sure it must be a good thing. Thanks again!
